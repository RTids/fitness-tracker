# fitness-tracker

This was a personal project I have created to help me track my current progress.
I utilised new Javascript methods I had learnt, and with the use of Local Storage I have been able to store previous entries.

This was a lot of fun to make and really tested my current knowledge and Googling skills, as there were many steps where I felt completely stuck, but I persisted through and I am proud of the result.

There are a few thing I will would like to do with this app in the future as my skills progress.

- Make mobile responsive
- Implement subtle animations
- Change color on postive and negative progess
- Store first initial input to compare against current inputs

If you happen to stumble across this, please do let me know if you have any ideas I could add, and if my existing code could be improved.

Thanks!
